## About

Glaciera is a fork and modernization of **mp3berg** by Krister Brus, which itself was based on the original **jb** jukebox by Kristian Wiklund. This project brings the classic terminal music player into the modern era with:

- **Modern configuration system** using TOML format
- **XDG Base Directory compliance** for proper file locations
- **Theme support** with full RGB color customization
- **Multiple music directory support** for complex music libraries
- **Enhanced fuzzy search** and playlist management
- **SQLite database backend** for fast music library indexing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Meson build system
- ncurses with wide character support
- SQLite3 development libraries
- Audio libraries: libvorbis, libogg, libflac
- mpg123 and ogg123 for playback

### Build and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/itspluxstahre/glaciera.git
cd glaciera

# Configure and build
meson setup builddir
ninja -C builddir

# Install (optional)
sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

### Development

During development, run uninstalled binaries from the build directory:

```bash
# Build changes
ninja -C builddir

# Run Glaciera (music player)
./builddir/src/glaciera

# Run indexer (scan music library)
./builddir/src/glaciera-indexer /path/to/your/music
```

## Configuration

Glaciera uses a modern TOML-based configuration system with XDG compliance:

- **Config file**: `~/.config/glaciera/config.toml`
- **Themes**: `~/.config/glaciera/themes/`
- **Database**: `~/.local/share/glaciera/glaciera.db`

### First Run

On first launch, Glaciera automatically creates the configuration directory and a default `config.toml` file with helpful examples.

### Multiple Music Directories

Configure multiple music directories in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[paths]
index = [
    "/home/user/Music",
    "/mnt/nas/music",
    "/media/external/audio",
]
```

Then index them:
```bash
glaciera-indexer /home/user/Music /mnt/nas/music /media/external/audio
```

### Themes

Glaciera supports full RGB color themes. Copy theme files from `themes/` to `~/.config/glaciera/themes/` and select them in your config:

```toml
[appearance]
theme = "nord"  # or "gruvbox"
```

Included themes:
- **Nord** (default) - Modern arctic-inspired palette
- **Gruvbox** - Warm retro groove colors

See [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md) for complete configuration documentation.

glaciera-indexer -f /path/to/music
```

## Project History

Glaciera continues a long tradition of terminal-based music players:

1. **jb** (1997) - Original curses jukebox by Kristian Wiklund
2. **mp3berg** (2000-2010) - Enhanced version by Krister Brus with MP3 support
3. **Glaciera** (2025) - Modern fork by Plux Stahre with TOML config and themes

Each iteration builds upon the previous while adding modern conveniences and maintaining the core philosophy: a powerful, keyboard-driven music player that runs anywhere.

### Code Formatting

Before submitting a pull request, please format all code using clang-format:

```bash
ninja -C builddir format
```
