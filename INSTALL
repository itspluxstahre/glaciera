Build & Install
===============

The project is now built with Meson. You will need development headers
for ncurses (or ncursesw), libogg, libvorbis (including libvorbisfile),
and libFLAC. On Debian/Ubuntu this roughly equates to:

    sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja-build \
         libncursesw5-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libflac-dev

Once the dependencies are present you can configure, build, and install:

    meson setup builddir
    ninja -C builddir
    sudo ninja -C builddir install

If you want to run the binaries without installing, execute them directly
from `builddir/src/mp3berg` and `builddir/src/mp3build`.

Runtime helpers such as mpg321 or vorbis-tools are still useful for playback
and tagging; install those from your preferred package manager as needed.
