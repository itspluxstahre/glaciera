	jb - a curses based 'jukebox'
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every piece of software comes from a basic need. My need was to have
a vt220 terminal close to my stereo system, to be able to select
which tunes to play without having to move myself to my workstation.

(Hence the lack of colors.)

Keystroke commands later in this file.

Note that the author of this program in no way encourage distributing
copyrighted music as mp3-files. Don't blame me for other people's illegal
activities.

To install the program, run "./configure" and do 'make install'.
(Or make, and copy the jb binary somewhere, "mkdir $PREFIX/lib/jb",
followed by "cp JBHELP $PREFIX/lib/jb", where $PREFIX is the dir
specified as --prefix to ./configure (/usr/local, if you havn't
specified anything))

The 'configure' script is a generic "autoconf" script. To find out
which options are accepted, please type "./configure --help".

If ncurses is located somewhere where the configure script have problems
finding it (such as /usr/pdfree/*, in my case...) the two options
for locating the include file and lib file are quite handy. 
"./configure --help" for more details.
 
The index file is generated by running the script 'genindex' with
the path to where your mp-files are stored. (The format is
simple, first a number telling how many tunes there are, then a
tune on each line. After the tune path comes a ':' followed by a
number that is the length of the tune in seconds. 0 means that we havn't
measured the length yet.)

I've tested compiling the program under various setups I have rlogin
access to. Unfortunately this means that I don't know if mpg123 works
for all systems jb works for. (If I can't get there and listen...)

If you are using some other configuration, please mail me the gory details.

Tested systems:

HW	OS		CC		Status

Keystroke commands:

main window (the one that you start with)

up-arrow, down-arrow, corresponding vi-keys: move list up and down
left and right-arrow, corresponding vi-keys: change output volume
      (there is a '*' in the top bar, showing the current setting.)
p: play the tune we currently have the cursor on
P: play all tagged tunes. Actually, this creates a new playlist (and
   destroys the one in memory) and plays it.
r: create a playlist from all tagged tunes, shuffle it, play it.
t: tag/untag a tune
~: select/deselect all tunes. The top tune determines what happens.
   (if it is unselected, all tunes are selected etc.)
q: quit
v: view current playlist (no edit, comes in later version)
a: add tune to playlist (mostly unusable, unless you have pressed 'P' or
   'r' and decides you want to listen to foo_bar.mp3 as well.
?: display this file 
esc: stop playing whatever is playing

playlist window

q: return to main window
